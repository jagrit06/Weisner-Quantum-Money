# Weisner Quantum Money

I built the following project while learning about Quantum Computing, Quantum Cryptography and Qiskit

## Explore Quantum Money by demonstrating the Weisner Protocol

The process of building and verifying a quantum note with the Weisner Protocol is a process similar to BB84 QKD Scheme, but can give provide good insight into the use of no-cloning theorem in quantum cryptography

### Objectives
<ol>
<li>Show the building of a note by a Bank</li>
<li>Show the verfication process of a valid note by a Bank</li>
<li>Show a forgery attempt by an Adversary (including failed verification)</li>
<li>Discuss Drawbacks of weisner scheme</li>
<li>Break/Forge Weisner notes if bank returns invalid notes (if time permits)</li>
<ul>
<li>Show the standard trial and error attack (bank can detect forgeries)</li>
<li>Show an adaptive attack (bank can't detect with high prob )</li>
</ul>
</ol>
